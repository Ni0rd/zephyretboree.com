  text2: The vessel, whose launching is planned for 2022, will be built and operated by a joint venture with our partner Jifmar Offshore Service called Alizés. Being untrusted to transport of Ariane 6 launcher by ArianeGroup proves our capacity to develop specific and customised projects that meet complex industrial constraints.
